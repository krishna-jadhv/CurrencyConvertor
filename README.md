## **Key Learnings from This Project**
1. **Building Custom Hooks**  
   - Learned how to create reusable and modular custom hooks in React.
   - Followed best practices, such as naming hooks with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useCurrencyInfo`).

2. **API Integration**  
   - Gained experience in integrating APIs into a React project.
   - Understood the process of making API calls using `fetch` or other methods.

3. **Understanding React Hooks**  
   - Practical implementation of core React hooks such as:
     - **`useState`**: Managing state for input values and API responses.
     - **`useId`**: Generating unique IDs for form elements when required.

4. **Component Reusability and Optimization**  
   - Designed reusable components like `InputBox` to handle similar UI elements efficiently.
   - Implemented optimization techniques to ensure better performance and maintainability.

5. **Best Practices for Hooks**  
   - Followed conventions for hooks:
     - Use `.js` extension for files containing hooks, as they are JavaScript functions and not components.
     - Ensured hooks remain clean, readable, and maintainable.
